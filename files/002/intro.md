# Tokipona Rules.

### Tokipona Rule Number 02.
If the subject of a sentence is anything other than `mi` or `sina`, the predicate is separated from the subject with `li`.

For example:
- **mi pona**: I am good.
- **ona li pona**: He's good.


### Tokipona Rule Number 03.
Adjectives follow the nouns the modify.
Notice it is the opposite from the English Language, where the adjective comes first.

For example:
- **jan pona**: Good person (or, friend).
