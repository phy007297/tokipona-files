# Tokipona Rules.

### Li
If the subject of a sentence is anything other than `mi` or `sina`, the predicate is separated from the subject with `li`. You can think of the word `li` as roughly translating as either `is` or `are` in english.

For example:
- **mi pona**: I am good.
- **ona li pona**: He's good
- **ona li pona**: They are good.


### Adjectives.
Adjectives follow the nouns the modify.
Notice it is the opposite from the English Language, where the adjective comes first. This is common in languagues like: Spanish, Portuguese, and others.

For example:
- **jan pona**: Good person (or, friend).
- **jan ike**: Bad person (or, enemy).
