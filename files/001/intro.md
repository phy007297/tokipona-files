# Tokipona basics.

Tokipona is a very simple language. In fact, `toki` means language, and `pona` means simple!
There are many resources out there who teach tokipona, and you are invited to check the discord server, or some youtube video about it.

There are two important subjects in tokipona:
- `mi`: I, me.
- `sina`: You, Your.


If the subject of a sentence is 'mi' or 'sina', the predicate comes immediately after.
For example: 
- `mi moku` means: I eat.
- `mi pona` means: I'm good.
- `sina pona` means: You're good.
- `mi jan` means: I am a person.


That's it!
Super easy, isn't it?
